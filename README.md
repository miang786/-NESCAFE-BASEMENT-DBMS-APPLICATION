2.4 Nescafe Basement DBMS Application (30 Marks)
This should be the final step of your challenging yet exciting Nescafe Basement DBMS
Project. You have done remarkably well to get to this point. It is now time to bundle
the individual bits that you have developed up till now into a useful C# application. You
probably are familiar with a GUI application in C#, which is sufficient for this part of the
homework. All you need to do is to develop a C# application that allows users to
manipulate data and answer business question, i.e. generate reports.
Your application should have the following functionality:
1. Data Manipulation
a. Insert Data (e.g. insert an artist, insert a record, insert a season, etc.)
b. Update Data (e.g. update artist information, update record information,
etc.)
c. Delete Data (e.g. delete artist, delete season, delete record, etc.)
2. Reports
a. For each Business question (questions 1 to 10), generate the report,
i.e. show the results on console.

3 Final Homework Submission
Now that you are rather excited about your class project and already planning to start
working on it, you should bear following points in mind:
 The report is prepared using font size 12pts and line spacing 1.5.
 You may consult the relevant books, articles, internet, etc. whilst preparing this
report. However, please do not forget to use a proper referencing system.
 You are required to submit the complete C# project files in a zipped format
along with a detailed report (.doc file) describing how you have prepared
the Nescafe basement solution and the relevant screen shots.
 Please hand over the hard copies of your final report well before the deadline.
 Please note that any form of plagiarism will not be tolerated and will result
in zero credit for the project.
 Send your solution (code+report) as a zip file to sikandar.buic@bahria.edu.pk
with the subject and file name as “dbms-firstname-lastname-class” e.g. for Danish
ali from class 4A, write “dbms-danish-ali-4A”. If you do not name your submission

submission until 1 week after the deadline will be accepted, but the best score
you can get in a late submission is 50% of the total credit.
 Demos will be held in the same week during class/lab where you will have
to demonstrate about how you have developed the solution.

Good Luck 
